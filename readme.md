Overview

Predicting house prices is a classic machine learning problem. This repository explores several smart regression techniques—linear models, tree-based models, and ensemble methods—to develop a robust price prediction system.

Key Goals:

Handle missing data and outliers

Engineer meaningful features

Compare baseline and advanced regression techniques

Optimize and ensemble models for improved accuracy


Technologies Used

Python 3.10+

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebooks

Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-regression.git
cd house-price-regression

2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run notebooks or training scripts.

Dataset used: Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

Smart Regression Techniques

Linear Regression (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet)

Tree-Based Models (Decision Tree, Random Forest)

Boosting Algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)

Stacked Ensemble Modeling

Model performance is evaluated using:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Cross-validation scores

Results

The ensemble model achieved the best performance with a test RMSE of X.XXXX, outperforming single models.

Future Work

Integrate deep learning models (e.g., TabNet)

Deploy as a web app with Streamlit or Flask

Add automated feature selection
